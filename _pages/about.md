I'm a third year PhD in Machine Learning student at Georgia Tech advised by <a href="https://ae.gatech.edu/people/evangelos-theodorou" target="_blank"> Prof. Evangelos Theodorou</a>.

My research focuses on developing <b> distributed methods </b> for the control of <b> large-scale multi-agent systems </b>. In particular, drawing tools
from the areas of distributed optimization, stochastic optimal control and machine learning, my work aims in developing scalable and 
computationally efficient algorithms for controlling large-scale multi-robot teams. 

Prior to Georgia Tech, I graduated (top 1%) with a Diploma in ECE from the University of Patras in Greece, and was fortunate to be advised
by <a href="https://nereus.mech.ntua.gr/" target="_blank"> Prof. Evangelos Papadopoulos</a>.
