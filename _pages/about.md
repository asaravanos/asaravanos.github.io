I'm a third year PhD in Machine Learning student at Georgia Tech advised by <a href="https://ae.gatech.edu/people/evangelos-theodorou" target="_blank"> Prof. Evangelos Theodorou</a>. I also work closely with <a href="https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/bakolas"> Prof. Efstathios Bakolas</a> from UT Austin. 

My research focuses on developing <b> distributed methods </b> for the control of <b> large-scale multi-agent systems </b>. In particular, drawing tools
from the areas of distributed optimization, stochastic optimal control and machine learning, my work aims in developing scalable and 
computationally efficient algorithms for controlling large-scale multi-robot teams. 

Prior to Georgia Tech, I graduated (top 1%) with a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Patras in Greece, and was advised
by <a href="https://nereus.mech.ntua.gr/" target="_blank"> Prof. Evangelos Papadopoulos</a> and Prof. <a href="http://www.ece.upatras.gr/index.php/en/ece-faculty/koussoulas-nick.html" target="_blank"> Prof. Nick Koussoulas</a>.
