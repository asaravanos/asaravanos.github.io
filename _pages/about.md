I'm a third year PhD in Machine Learning student at Georgia Tech. I am fortunate to be part of the <a href="https://sites.gatech.edu/acds/" target="_blank"> Autonomous Control and Decision Systems Lab </a> 
and to be advised by <a href="https://ae.gatech.edu/people/evangelos-theodorou" 
target="_blank"> Prof. Evangelos Theodorou</a>. I also work closely with 
<a href="https://www.ae.utexas.edu/people/faculty/faculty-directory/bakolas"> Prof. Efstathios Bakolas</a> from UT Austin. 

My research focuses on developing <b> distributed methods </b> for the control of <b> large-scale multi-agent systems </b>. In particular, 
combining concepts
from the areas of distributed optimization, stochastic optimal control and machine learning, my work aims in developing scalable and 
computationally efficient decentralized algorithms for controlling multi-agent systems with thousands of robots!

Some indicative works are <b> <font color="#3EBC34">Distributed Differential Dynamic Programming</font> </b> 
<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.13255">[Paper (preprint)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tluvENcWldw"> Video]</a>, 
<b> <font color="#B91BDC"> Decentralized Multi-Agent Deep FBSDEs </font> </b> 
<a href="http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss18/p055.html">[Paper (RSS '22)</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qjPLUlaxJos"> Video]</a> 
and
<b> <font color="#D16124"> Distributed Covariance Steering </font> </b> 
<a href="http://www.roboticsproceedings.org/rss17/p075.html"> [Paper (RSS '21) </a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RiLQ2P1WXHQ"> Video]</a>.

Prior to Georgia Tech, I graduated (top 1%) with a Diploma in Electrical and Computer Engineering from the University of Patras in Greece, and was advised
by <a href="https://nereus.mech.ntua.gr/" target="_blank"> Prof. Evangelos Papadopoulos</a> and <a href="http://www.ece.upatras.gr/index.php/en/ece-faculty/koussoulas-nick.html" target="_blank"> Prof. Nick Koussoulas</a>.
